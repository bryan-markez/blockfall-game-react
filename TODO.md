# TODO
Not exactly sure in what order to do these things. We'll find out.

## Gameplay
1. Make pieces spawn in the middle
2. Implement a lose condition and add a button to restart the game
3. Implement a scoring system (some arbitrary scoring for lines cleared.
4. Implement a ghost piece system
5. Implement a 7-bag piece sysyem
6. Implement a hold system
7. Implement a piece preview system
8. Implement DAS, ARR, and SDR (tetris handling)


## Graphics
1. Make canvas bigger but keep the grid centered
2. Create sprites for the blocks to use (so they aren't just solid colors)
3. Implement animation for line clear
4. Implement animation for hard drop (like grid shaking)
5. Make the background and grid pretty :)


## UX
1. Setting menu where players can set their preferred keybinds for the controls
2. Allow players to adjust ARR, DAS, SDR (google what these mean in Tetris lingo) *requires Gameplay.8 to be done*
3. Add instructions/how-to-play somewhere on the side of the canvas
